# Welcome to FL Mods - A compendium of mods <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ibB1Te9.png" title="" alt="" width="40">

***This is a master collection of mods I have created, maintained and mods in development. You will find repositories for all public mods I have made available through Steam as well as other platforms. The purpose for this organisation is to keep all of my mod work catalogued and for preservation purposes.***

Formally GMT Mods I am bringing all of my work under the Fading Lotus Umbrella. Mods will be publically available here as well as [RimWorld : Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/294100/workshop/).
Rimworld mods although I'm discontinuing support for the forseeable future, I will work to keep mods updated with major game updates.
